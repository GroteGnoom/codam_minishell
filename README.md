# Minishell
In this 42 project you have to recreate a bash-like shell. This is a group project which you do in duos, I did the project together with Daniel Noom.

The aim of this project is to understand how a shell works and is structured.
You learn how to structure your first large project.
Furthermore, you learn how to make a system that works with unintended input without crashing.
This is also the first group project where you have to work in a small team of 2.
